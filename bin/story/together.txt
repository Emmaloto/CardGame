PART 1

    The plane trees in front of the Orphanage had never looked so charming, despite their gaunt and withering 
    disposition. As Meari stared at the wooden doors through which she would, in just a moment, pass through 
    to a world that she did not yet know, she remembered the day she had entered those same doors for the 
    first time. How scared she had been, and how scared she was now. A sob caught in her throat. She didn’t 
    want to go. She didn’t. 
    ‘Are you ready?’ asked Lady Erin. 
    Meari was not ready, but she was not about to admit this to Lady Erin. Lady Erin was a strict, no-nonsense 
woman; prim and proper even at the most inopportune of times, with her blonde hair always tied up in a tight 
bun at the back of her head. Her sharp blue eyes sought Meari’s hazel. Meari nodded. 
    ‘The gentleman is called Lord Narogrin,’ Lady Erin continued. ‘He comes from Solorthene, and it is there 
he will be taking you. Whatever you do, don’t stare.’
    Meari raised an eyebrow.
    ‘At what?’ she ventured.
    ‘Just don’t stare.’
    ‘Lady Erin?’
    ‘Hmm?’
    ‘Could I say goodbye to my brothers?’
    At this Lady Erin stiffened. 
    ‘They’re waiting for you out front.’ 
    Meari desperately tried to swallow the lump in her throat. She had never in her life imagined having to be 
apart from her brothers for more than a few days. And now, she did not know when she would see them again,
 if ever. No, she decided firmly, I will see them again. 
Together they walked out the wooden doors and down the front steps of the Orphanage. Lord Narogrin was waiting 
by the plane trees, with Raran and Tamar standing meekly opposite him. As the girls approached, Lord Narogrin 
performed a complicated bow. 
    Then Meari realized why she had been instructed not to stare.
    Lord Narogrin was a Dwarf.

      PART 2

    Meari had never seen a Dwarf before. She had heard of them enough, and she had read about them, 
but Dwarves were few and far between in Ngiron; their holds were stronger in Solorthene, which was a 
more mountainous island. She had heard tales of their ruthlessness and their cunning; their skill in 
weaponry and architecture were unrivalled; and it was said that no man yet had ever defeated a Dwarf 
in axe wielding. But Lord Narogrin looked friendly enough; his eyes twinkled and his beard, which 
reached his knees, was braided and well-combed; he wore a short blue robe and a grey cloak, with an 
axe at his belt. He grinned at Meari.
    'Well hello there! How are you, my dear?' 
    Meari curtsied quickly.
    'I'm well, my lord,' she answered. 
    'I see these are your brothers,' said Narogrin, still grinning. Meari wished he wouldn't grin so much. 
    'Yes. If I may …'
    'She would like to say goodbye,' interrupted Lady Erin.
    'Of course, of course,' said Narogrin. 'In the meantime, my lady, if I could speak to you …'
    The Dwarf led Lady Erin tactfully to the side, for which Meari was thankful. She looked at Raran 
    and Tamar and struggled to keep her tears in check. 
    Tamar ran forward and embraced her, openly sobbing. 
    'Don't go,' he cried. 'Don't go.'
    'I have to,' replied Meari, holding him close. The lump in her throat seemed to be growing. 
    'You be good, all right? Raran--take care of him, please, take care of yourself …'
    ‘Yes, Ri,’ sniffled Raran, joining in the hug. 
    ‘I’ll be back, all right? I won’t be gone forever. I’ll come back.’
    Tamar looked up at her, his wet eyes shimmering.
    ‘Do you promise? Do you promise that you’ll come back?’
    Meari nodded.
    ‘I promise. I promise. Take care of each other now, you hear? And--I’ll write, I’ll write to you--’
    ‘Meari, it’s time to go.’

PART 3

    Lady Erin loomed over them like a pale wraith of doom, and Meari turned her head to find 
Lord Narogrin waiting expectantly. Hurriedly she kissed both her brothers on the forehead, and 
walked over to where the Dwarf was standing. He grinned what was supposed to be a winning grin, 
but Meari did not find it half so appealing as he was hoping she would. 
    The carriage was waiting for them. Meari went in first, and Narogrin followed. She started waving 
at Raran and Tamar, and continued to wave until they turned a corner, and they were out of sight. 
                    ================+================
    Meari sat back in her seat, fervently wiping away her tears. 
    ‘Here,’ said Narogrin, offering her a silk handkerchief. 
    She took it gingerly, and wiped her eyes. 
    ‘Thank you,’ she said, and made to return it to him but he waved his hand dismissively. 
    ‘You keep it,’ he said. ‘Consider it an act of goodwill.’ 
    The carriage rumbled through the streets of Cador Urome. Meari could hear the bright 
chitter-chatter outside, and wondered if it would be worth it if she leapt out of the carriage 
and ran back to the orphanage. But no, it would be futile. Lord Narogrin would pursue her, and 
at any rate Lady Erin would send her right back. 
    ‘What do you do in Solorthene?’ she ventured. 
    ‘I work in the castle,’ said Narogrin, pleased at her sudden curiosity. ‘I’m the King’s 
chief astronomer.’
    ‘You’re a Dwarf!’ she exclaimed, before realizing what she had said. ‘I’m sorry, it’s just 
that Dwarves aren’t supposed to be astronomers.’
    Narogrin smiled. 
    ‘It’s not the traditional route, no,’ he said, ‘but I love the stars, and have made a name for 
myself since leaving home. King Samaran is a noble king, and was kind enough to let me be an apprentice 
to his chief astronomer when I started--Master Yarrow died a year ago, and I was promoted.’
    Meari processed this. 
    ‘Why did you adopt me?’ she asked.

PART 4

    ‘My dear, I am old and in need of company,’ he replied. ‘I will teach you my methods, and you
will be comfortable in the Towered City. How old are you?’
    ‘I’m seventeen.’
    ‘You’re about the princess’s age.’
    ‘The princess?’
    ‘Samarax. She’s a lovely creature.’ 
    The carriage left the city gates and stopped at the Harbour. Meari heard the sea before 
she saw it, and in her eagerness she all but slammed the carriage door in Lord Narogrin’s face. 
The vastness took her by surprise. She knew that there had to be an end somewhere; for at the end
of the vast cerulean was Solorthene, a place she knew so little about, and yet, a place where she 
was expected to spend the rest of her life. 
    Narogrin paid the carriage driver, and nudged Meari.
    ‘Come along,’ he said. ‘Our ship is not far off.’
    It was one of the larger ships, aptly named the Stormer. Its sails were grey and its figurehead 
was that of a large stork. Meari wondered what that was supposed to mean, but she did not have much 
time to dwell on it - Narogrin was confidently marching up the plank and onto the prow. 
She quickly followed. 
    ‘Captain Argos!’ cried Narogrin, shaking the hand of a plump, red-faced man in sailor attire.
    ‘How are you?’
    ‘Narogrin, old boy! It’s been a while!’ Argos laughed, a deep bellied laugh that emanated 
through his entire being. ‘And who is this?’
    ‘This is Lady Meari, my travelling companion,’ said Narogrin.
    Meari was slightly taken aback. She had never been called Lady Meari before, nor had she ever 
been anyone’s travelling companion. Is that what I am? she thought to herself, or is he too 
embarrassed to tell the captain I’m his adopted daughter? 
    She curtsied. She told Captain Argos that it was lovely to meet him. He responded with a hearty 
hello and a sloppy kiss on her hand. 
    ‘We’ll be setting sail in half an hour,’ said Argos. ‘Let me escort you to your chambers.’

PART 5

    Their quarters were separate, for which Meari was thankful. She locked her door and threw 
herself on the bed, unleashing the sobs and the tears that she had so far been able to hold in. 
She kept seeing Raran and Tamar’s faces in her mind’s eye, as memory after memory flooded her 
brain, and then the resounding fear that she might, despite her promise and despite her vague 
and blind hope, never see them again. 
    She wept until her lungs ached, until her tears gave out. 
    The ship was well across the waters when she fell asleep. 

    In the morning there was a knock on the door. 
    ‘Meari? Are you awake?’ 
    Meari rolled off the bed, stumbled over, and unlocked the door. Narogrin stood in the threshold,
looking concerned. 
    ‘Are you all right?’
    When she spoke, her voice was a croak.
    ‘I don’t feel too well,’ she managed.
    Her legs felt like they would give way any minute. She staggered back to her bed just as the ship 
lurched forward and Meari’s insides lurched with it.
    ‘It takes a few days to find your sea legs,’ said Narogrin, understandingly. ‘You rest, I’ll get 
someone to bring your food to you. And we should be docking at Solorthene by evening, so - rest until then.’
    Meari found a bucket and proceeded to empty her insides into it. 

    She slept for most of the day, and ate a little of the bread and cheese one of the sailors 
brought in for her. When they finally docked, she was more than relieved. Narogrin came to fetch her, 
and they said their farewells to the captain. 
    Another carriage, drawn by what looked like mountain goats, awaited them. 
    ‘It’s a two day ride to the city,’ said Narogrin. ‘I hope you’ll enjoy this journey more than 
you did the last.’
    ‘At least I learned something,’ Meari said, smiling.
    ‘What would that be?’
    ‘I should not consider a career in seafaring.’
    Narogrin laughed.
