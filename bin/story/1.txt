PART 1

    The plane trees in front of the Orphanage had never looked so charming, despite their gaunt and withering 
    disposition. As Meari stared at the wooden doors through which she would, in just a moment, pass through 
    to a world that she did not yet know, she remembered the day she had entered those same doors for the 
    first time. How scared she had been, and how scared she was now. A sob caught in her throat. She didn’t 
    want to go. She didn’t. 
    ‘Are you ready?’ asked Lady Erin. 
    Meari was not ready, but she was not about to admit this to Lady Erin. Lady Erin was a strict, no-nonsense 
woman; prim and proper even at the most inopportune of times, with her blonde hair always tied up in a tight 
bun at the back of her head. Her sharp blue eyes sought Meari’s hazel. Meari nodded. 
    ‘The gentleman is called Lord Narogrin,’ Lady Erin continued. ‘He comes from Solorthene, and it is there 
he will be taking you. Whatever you do, don’t stare.’
    Meari raised an eyebrow.
    ‘At what?’ she ventured.
    ‘Just don’t stare.’
    ‘Lady Erin?’
    ‘Hmm?’
    ‘Could I say goodbye to my brothers?’
    At this Lady Erin stiffened. 
    ‘They’re waiting for you out front.’ 
    Meari desperately tried to swallow the lump in her throat. She had never in her life imagined having to be 
apart from her brothers for more than a few days. And now, she did not know when she would see them again,
 if ever. No, she decided firmly, I will see them again. 
Together they walked out the wooden doors and down the front steps of the Orphanage. Lord Narogrin was waiting 
by the plane trees, with Raran and Tamar standing meekly opposite him. As the girls approached, Lord Narogrin 
performed a complicated bow. 
    Then Meari realized why she had been instructed not to stare.
    Lord Narogrin was a Dwarf.
