Welcome to Emmanuel's card game!!
This is a simple one. Basically match up all the cards by flipping over
two identical ones at once.


Press h to show/hide this screen.
Press Esc to close the game.

I would like info on bugs, things that are not working right, and 
general improvements. This is a very rough version, so do not expect 
too much. There is  lot of work to be done on the graphics and cards, 
and new functions to be added. 

E-mail me at icylaze16@gmail.com to send in your info! Any 
constructive criticism is greatly appreciated!!! :)
