PART 4

    'My dear, I am old and in need of company,' he replied. 'I will teach you my methods, and you
will be comfortable in the Towered City. How old are you?'
    'I'm seventeen.'
    'You're about the princess's age.'
    'The princess?'
    'Samarax. She's a lovely creature.' 
    The carriage left the city gates and stopped at the Harbour. Meari heard the sea before 
she saw it, and in her eagerness she all but slammed the carriage door in Lord Narogrin's face. 
The vastness took her by surprise. She knew that there had to be an end somewhere; for at the end
of the vast cerulean was Solorthene, a place she knew so little about, and yet, a place where she 
was expected to spend the rest of her life. 
    Narogrin paid the carriage driver, and nudged Meari.
    'Come along,' he said. 'Our ship is not far off.'
    It was one of the larger ships, aptly named the Stormer. Its sails were grey and its figurehead 
was that of a large stork. Meari wondered what that was supposed to mean, but she did not have much 
time to dwell on it - Narogrin was confidently marching up the plank and onto the prow. 
She quickly followed. 
    'Captain Argos!' cried Narogrin, shaking the hand of a plump, red-faced man in sailor attire.
    'How are you?'
    'Narogrin, old boy! It's been a while!' Argos laughed, a deep bellied laugh that emanated 
through his entire being. 'And who is this?'
    'This is Lady Meari, my travelling companion,' said Narogrin.
    Meari was slightly taken aback. She had never been called Lady Meari before, nor had she ever 
been anyone's travelling companion. Is that what I am? she thought to herself, or is he too 
embarrassed to tell the captain I'm his adopted daughter? 
    She curtsied. She told Captain Argos that it was lovely to meet him. He responded with a hearty 
hello and a sloppy kiss on her hand. 
    'We'll be setting sail in half an hour,' said Argos. 'Let me escort you to your chambers.'
