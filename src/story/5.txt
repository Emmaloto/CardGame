PART 5

    Their quarters were separate, for which Meari was thankful. She locked her door and threw 
herself on the bed, unleashing the sobs and the tears that she had so far been able to hold in. 
She kept seeing Raran and Tamar's faces in her mind's eye, as memory after memory flooded her 
brain, and then the resounding fear that she might, despite her promise and despite her vague 
and blind hope, never see them again. 
    She wept until her lungs ached, until her tears gave out. 
    The ship was well across the waters when she fell asleep. 

    In the morning there was a knock on the door. 
    'Meari? Are you awake?' 
    Meari rolled off the bed, stumbled over, and unlocked the door. Narogrin stood in the threshold,
looking concerned. 
    'Are you all right?'
    When she spoke, her voice was a croak.
    'I don't feel too well,' she managed.
    Her legs felt like they would give way any minute. She staggered back to her bed just as the ship 
lurched forward and Meari's insides lurched with it.
    'It takes a few days to find your sea legs,' said Narogrin, understandingly. 'You rest, I'll get 
someone to bring your food to you. And we should be docking at Solorthene by evening, so - rest until then.'
    Meari found a bucket and proceeded to empty her insides into it. 

    She slept for most of the day, and ate a little of the bread and cheese one of the sailors 
brought in for her. When they finally docked, she was more than relieved. Narogrin came to fetch her, 
and they said their farewells to the captain. 
    Another carriage, drawn by what looked like mountain goats, awaited them. 
    'It's a two day ride to the city,' said Narogrin. 'I hope you'll enjoy this journey more than 
you did the last.'
    'At least I learned something,' Meari said, smiling.
    'What would that be?'
    'I should not consider a career in seafaring.'
    Narogrin laughed.
