PART 2

    Meari had never seen a Dwarf before. She had heard of them enough, and she had read about them, 
but Dwarves were few and far between in Ngiron; their holds were stronger in Solorthene, which was a 
more mountainous island. She had heard tales of their ruthlessness and their cunning; their skill in 
weaponry and architecture were unrivalled; and it was said that no man yet had ever defeated a Dwarf 
in axe wielding. But Lord Narogrin looked friendly enough; his eyes twinkled and his beard, which 
reached his knees, was braided and well-combed; he wore a short blue robe and a grey cloak, with an 
axe at his belt. He grinned at Meari.
    'Well hello there! How are you, my dear?' 
    Meari curtsied quickly.
    'I'm well, my lord,' she answered. 
    'I see these are your brothers,' said Narogrin, still grinning. Meari wished he wouldn't grin so much. 
    'Yes. If I may ...'
    'She would like to say goodbye,' interrupted Lady Erin.
    'Of course, of course,' said Narogrin. 'In the meantime, my lady, if I could speak to you ...'
    The Dwarf led Lady Erin tactfully to the side, for which Meari was thankful. She looked at Raran 
    and Tamar and struggled to keep her tears in check. 
    Tamar ran forward and embraced her, openly sobbing. 
    'Don't go,' he cried. 'Don't go.'
    'I have to,' replied Meari, holding him close. The lump in her throat seemed to be growing. 
    'You be good, all right? Raran--take care of him, please, take care of yourself ...'
    'Yes, Ri,' sniffled Raran, joining in the hug. 
    'I'll be back, all right? I won't be gone forever. I'll come back.'
    Tamar looked up at her, his wet eyes shimmering.
    'Do you promise? Do you promise that you'll come back?'
    Meari nodded.
    'I promise. I promise. Take care of each other now, you hear? And--I'll write, I'll write to you--'
    'Meari, it's time to go.'
