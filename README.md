This is a memory card game, where the goal is to flip two identical cards to match them andd clear all off the board. You can select certain numbers of cards to play with, and you can push a Restart button to restart anytime you want.
 I made this to get a better grasp on how game logic works, as well as practice in randomizing arrays and using GUIs. I am doing my best to constantly update this program, and I welcome any tips/concerns.

Functions:
- Pick from 6, 8, 12, 16 and 20 cards to play, or let the computer select a mode for you.
- Press h for help/program information.
- Restart game with button.
- End screen when game is won with info on the number of clicks.
- Get special prize when you finish game in certain number of clicks!


Hope you enjoy!
